        <h1>Why Renters Insurance is Essential for Tenants</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Renting a home or apartment comes with great flexibility, but it also presents risks. <strong>Renters insurance</strong> provides protection against unforeseen circumstances such as theft, fire, or water damage. Without proper coverage, tenants could face significant financial losses.</p>
        
        <h2>What Does Renters Insurance Cover?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Property Protection</strong> – Covers your belongings in case of theft, fire, or natural disasters.</li>
            <li><strong>Liability Coverage</strong> – Protects you in case someone is injured in your rental unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Additional Living Expenses</strong> – Helps with temporary housing costs if your rental becomes uninhabitable.</li>
        </ul>
